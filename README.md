5. Enter: “First graph” into the Title Edit Box

LIST OF USER INPUTS
In the top left there is a “QUIT” push button. This is clicked on when you want to stop/exit the application
On the left, below the “QUIT” push button, is a button group with the title “Line Style.” Here, you can select from 5 options of line and/or marker styles with which to graph your plot. To select a style, simply click the circle next to your desired line style choice.
On the left of the application, below the “Line Style” button group, lies a button group with the title “Line Color.” Here, you can select from 3 options of line and/or marker color with which to graph your plot. To select a color, simply click the circle next to your desired color choice.
In the button left corner, below the “Line Color” button group, lies two edit boxes. Here you input the points you want to graph.
Once entered into each edit box, the number entered into one text box (x or y) will be plotted with the integer entered into the other text box (x or y) that is in the same position. For example, if you input “1, 2, 3, 4, 5” in the x-position edit box and input “6, 7, 8, 9, 10” into the y-position edit box, then the first point will be (1,6), the second point will be (2,7), the third point will be (3,8), etc….You can use decimals and negative numbers as well.
In the bottom right hand corner there is a “Title Name” edit box, a “Y-Axis Name” edit box, and a “X-Axis Name” edit box. Each of these have preset text in them for direction. If you do not want that text included in the actual titles, then you will need to erase that text. Once you have entered the title that you do want, simply hit enter or click somewhere on the application but not on the edit box, and your title will appear on the graph.
In the bottom right hand corner there is a “Reset Graph and Inputs” push button. If you click on this button, all of the edit boxes (Y-Position, X-Position, and all 3 Title names) will be reset. Furthermore, the plot will be reset to having no titles or graph.
In the bottom right hand corner there is a “Graph” push button. This button will graph the points that you input into the Y-Position and X-Position input box with the Line Color and Line Style you choose when clicked on.

DIRECTIONS:
In the command window, type “finalProject2.” Alternatively, you can press the “Run” command at the top of the MATLAB interface.
THE FOLLOWING STEPS CAN HAVE VARIABLE SEQUENCING (THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH YOU INPUT DATA DOES NOT EFFECT THE END RESULT, THE GRAPH).
Pick a Line Style; do this by clicking on the circle by your desired line style in the left side of the application.
Pick a Line Color; do this by clicking on the circle by your desired line color in the left side of the application.
Enter your point data. Do this by entering all of the x positions (in the order you want them graphed) in the x-position edit box. Next, enter all of the y positions (in the same order/sequence as their x-position partner) into the y-position edit box. If there is an error, read the directions of the error to determine its cause. After doing so, you should easily be able to spot and fix the input error. You can enter integers, decimal points, and negative numbers into the application. 
Enter your graph’s title name. Do this by clicking on the “Title Name: “ edit box and typing in your desired title. If you do not want “Title Name: “ to be included, you must erase it. Next press enter.
Enter your graph’s Y-Axis name. Do this by clicking on the “Y-Axis Name: “ edit box and typing in your desired title. If you do not want “Y-Axis Name: “ to be included, you must erase it. Next press enter.
Enter your graph’s X-Axis name. Do this by clicking on the “X-Axis Name: “ edit box and typing in your desired title. If you do not want “X-Axis Name: “ to be included, you must erase it. Next press enter.
Press the “Graph” push button in the bottom right corner. This will graph your x and y inputs along with the line style and line color that you chose. You can use this graph function endlessly without a previous graph being cleared. To do so, simply change your inputs and click “graph” again. If you do this, two graphs will be displayed (unless both graphs have the same input, which, in that case, the second is simply overlaid and not noticeable to the user).
If you wish to reset your graph and edit boxes, click the “Reset Graph and Inputs” in the bottom right corner. This will reset the graph to its initial conditions.
If you wish to exit the application, simply click the “QUIT” push button in the upper left corner.
